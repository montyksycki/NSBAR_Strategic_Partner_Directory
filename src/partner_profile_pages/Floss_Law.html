Bob Floss II has been a practicing real estate attorney for 15 years. He brings his background growing up in a family real estate brokerage to every transaction. Bob started out his legal career working extensively with short sales and bankruptcies as a result of the Great Recession. As the economy recovered, the market changed and Bob began to focus on apartment buildings and asset protection. Today we pride ourselves in being a full service real estate law firm that can assist our clients in buying and selling their home, guide them into making their first investment, and build a long standing relationship along the way.

We are prepared to answer questions about closing costs, title insurance, real estate investments, asset protection, setting up an LLC, appealing property taxes, or evictions.  Give us a call and know you have an attorney experienced in real estate on your side.

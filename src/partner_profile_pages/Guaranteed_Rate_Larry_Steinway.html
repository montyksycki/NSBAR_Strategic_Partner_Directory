I entered the mortgage business in 1990. My sister was a Processor at a small brokerage and the owner needed more Loan Officer's. Also, my Mom was a real estate agent so all the cards were lining up for me to enter the industry. To me, this one of the best jobs a person can have. The harder and smarter you work the more opportunities present themselves. Over my career I have funded in excess of $1.4 Billion dollars in loans. I have been fortunate to be in the top 1% of Loan Originators in the United States year after year. I attended Illinois State University and studied Business and Communication. I also played Hockey at the University which was a great experience and taught leadership and team building skills which I use today. I grew up in Northbrook, IL and have lived for the past 17 years in Deerfield, IL. My wife Elizabeth grew up in Deerfield so we are definitely a "hometown" family. Both of my daughters are passionate about figure skating, and always keep me and my wife on my toes. One of my favorite hobbies is playing bass guitar with my buddies in our band at the local pubs occasionally.
